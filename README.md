### Link to the project

## Getting started
### Prerequisities
This app uses [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) to manage its dependences and packages. The following dependencies are required to run this app:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en): This application relies on Node.js to run the server.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) or [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas): A MongoDB database is required for data storage. A local instance of MongoDB or a cloud instance through MongoDB Atlas can be used.
- [Google Books API Key](https://developers.google.com/books): An API key from Google Books is necessary to enable the appâ€™s book search functionality.
